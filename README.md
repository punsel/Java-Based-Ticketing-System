# Java-Based-Ticketing-System

DESCRIPTION:

This Java-based ticket booking system was developed during my first year in Computer Science, aiming to provide users with a seamless platform for booking tickets to movies, concerts, and airplane flights. The system offers an intuitive interface that allows users to browse through available options, select their desired event or flight, choose their preferred seating, and complete the booking process with different online payment options. It incorporates various features such as user login, ticket pricing with discounts based on quantity, and automated email confirmations sent to the user's Gmail account. The system leverages core Java concepts, including conditional statements, switch-case, loops, arrays, and methods, to manage different types of tickets, calculate discounts, and handle user interactions efficiently.
